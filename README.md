## About
The pandemic is sweeping through countries like India and Brazil at a pace that has staggered scientists.With dwindling oxygen supplies and ventilators, physicians are watching helplessly as patients perish from preventable deaths.
This project deals with the current rising problem. In this project we have taken the dataset of patients which contains the data whether the patients need ICU/ventilator service or not. Based on this dataset the project learns and predict on the new dataset of patients whether they need ICU service. If we know beforehand about the patients then we can predict about their future needs and conditions. This can save a lot of life who are dying just due to lack of unavailablity of ventilators. This project is impactful for the current scenerio in all different countries like India, Brazil etc where this project can be used to manage and arrange ventilators.
